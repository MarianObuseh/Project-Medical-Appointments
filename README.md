# Project Medical Appointments
In this work, I explore a dataset containing information of 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil. The aim of this analysis is
to have more insights on what variables could have attributed to patients missing their appointments. More background details as 
well as the codes are of this repo. I put out a caveat that this project is more of concreting concepts of Exploratory Data Visualizations. 
Therefore, the visualizations lack key ingredients of Explanatory Data Analysis including but not limited to Low Chart Junk in terms of
high Data-Ink Ratio, Design Integrity in terms of Lie Factor of 1 or lower and Design for Color Blindness. Regardless, it showed clear
findings from the stance of the Data Analyst - me. I encourage that while going through the notebook, you assume the role of a Data Analyst
rather than that of a stakeholder or decision maker.
